**LAB 1: Study and Demonstration of Ethernet Cabling**

Straight Through and Crossover Connections 

## OBJECTIVES: 

- To study the basics of Ethernet cabling used in computer networks. 

- To identify end devices (Category A) and networking devices (Category B) based on 

their transmit (TX) and receive (RX) pins. 

- To gain knowledge of network cable termination and connectivity principles. 

## THEORY 

Ethernet is one of the most widely used technologies for Local Area Networks (LANs). It 

provides a standardized method for connecting computers and networking devices using twisted-

pair cables such as Category 5 (Cat5) and Category 6 (Cat6). Ethernet communication relies on 

electrical signals that travel through specific pairs of wires within the cable. 

An Ethernet cable consists of eight copper wires arranged as four twisted pairs and is terminated 

using an RJ-45 connector. Each wire follows a specific color code defined by international 

standards such as TIA/EIA-568A or TIA/EIA-568B. Correct color coding is essential to ensure 

accurate data transmission and reception between devices. 

In Ethernet communication, devices are broadly classified into two categories based on their pin 

configuration: 

- **Category A (End Devices):** These include devices such as personal computers, laptops,

and printers. End devices transmit data through pins 1 and 2 (TX) and receive data 

through pins 3 and 6 (RX). 

- **Category B (Networking Devices):** These include switches and hubs. Networking 

devices transmit data through pins 3 and 6 (TX) and receive data through pins 1 and 2 

(RX). 

## Demonstration of Ethernet Casting 



## Straight-Through Connection 

A straight-through Ethernet cable is used to connect different types of devices, such as a PC to a 

switch or a router to a hub. In this type of cable, the pin numbers and color codes are identical on 

both ends of the cable (either TIA/EIA-568A on both ends or TIA/EIA-568B on both ends). This 

configuration allows proper communication between the transmitting and receiving pins of 

different device type. 







## Connection of Crossover: 

A crossover Ethernet cable is used to connect similar types of devices, such as PC to PC or switch to 

switch. In this cable, the transmit and receive wire pairs are crossed, meaning pins 1 and 2 on one 

end are connected to pins 3 and 6 on the other end, and vice versa. This crossing enables direct 

communication between devices with the same pin configuration. 




## DISCUSSION 

In this lab, Ethernet cabling techniques were studied with an emphasis on straight-through and    

crossover connections. The functional differences between end devices and networking devices were 

analyzed based on their transmit and receive pin arrangements. It was observed that straight-through 

cables are suitable for connecting dissimilar devices, while crossover cables are required for 

connecting similar devices by interchanging the transmit and receive pairs. 



## CONCLUSION 

Hence, ethernet casting was studied and demonstroted using straight through cabling and  

crossover cabling connections.
